## **Project Introduction**<br/>

In this project, I will analyzing data provided by [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/). <br/>
Data contains pre-labeled tweets and text messages that are received during real life disasters. <br/>
Objective is to prepare the data with ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline & then use a ML(Machine Learning) pipeline to build a supervised learning model to categorize the events and look out for any trends.<br/> 
This will help emergency workers to classify/categorize the events and send the messages to appropriate disaster relief agency.
